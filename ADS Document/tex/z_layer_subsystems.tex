\subsection{Linear Actuator Subsystem}
The linear actuator is what moves the end effector down and up in order to grip an object

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The subsystem will be able to receive commands in order to know when to operate its movement

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
This subsystem is responsible for receiving its commands and making its movements when it should in a timely manner.

\subsection{Motor Step Movement Subsystem}
The Stepper Motors are what moves the joints of the robot arm.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The subsystem will be able to receive commands in order to know when to operate its movement

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
This subsystem is responsible for receiving its commands and making its movements when it should in a timely manner.

\subsection{Encoder Position Subsystem}
The Encoder subsystem should be able to take the angle of the arm joints and communicate the angle positions in order to provide motion control.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The subsystem will be able to receive commands in order to know when to operate its control

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
This subsystem is responsible for receiving its commands and controling the movement accurately.

\subsection{Air Pump Subsystem}
This subsystem receives commands to operate the vacuum air pump which manipulates the gripper and allows the gripper to hold onto objects.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The subsystem will be able to receive commands in order to know when to operate vacuum.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
This subsystem is responsible for receiving its commands and operating when it should in a timely manner.
